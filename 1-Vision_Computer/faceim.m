%The cascade object detector uses the Viola-Jones algorithm to detect peopleâ€™s
% faces, noses, eyes, mouth, or upper body. You can also use the Image Labeler
% to train a custom classifier to use with this System object. For details on
% how the function works, see Get Started with Cascade Object Detector.

%The function can train the model using Haar-like features,
% histograms of oriented gradients (HOG), or local binary patterns (LBP)
