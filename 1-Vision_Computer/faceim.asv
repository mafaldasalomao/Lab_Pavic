%The cascade object detector uses the Viola-Jones algorithm to detect peopleâ€™s faces, noses, eyes, mouth, or upper body. You can also use the Image Labeler to train a custom classifier to use with this System object. For details on how the function works, see Get Started with Cascade Object Detector.
